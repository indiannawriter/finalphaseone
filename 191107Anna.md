# finalphaseone
This is phase one of the final project for fall 18 python

I have uploaded the latest that I have done. 
This is left:
      Draw histograms for columns A2-A10. Note: you need to subset your dataframe - slice only columns A2-A10. Use histogram function, add a color of your choice. Note you need to run hist() function on your dataframe with selected columns only. It will output all 9 columns as subplots. Here do not worry about individual titles, y and x axis. You could adjust bins and alpha (opacity) on your histograms

Hint: Use this layout after calling hist(): plt.tight_layout(rect=(0, 0, 1.2, 1.2))  - to make it fit better. You can also turn grid off in histograms by adding grid=False to hist() parameters. Feel free to explore hist() parameters to enhance the look of histograms.

    Draw a bar plot for CLASS - you can use groupby to see counts of  benign and malignant values or you can count values directly using pd.value_counts() function and apply it to plot.bar() function.
    Draw a scatterplot of any two columns. 
    Summarize by reporting which values might need standardization in the future (too much variation) and any other observations that you may discover as a Data Scientist.

And this:
Github set up with one folder for code and one folder for dataset 5pts  From Anna: I don't see where to differentiate folders here
Readme file with contributions 5pts  From Anna: I can add to this when I get back next week

NICK: it looks like the jupyter notebook req is no longer needed!
